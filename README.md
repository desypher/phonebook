Phonebook Application by Brynn Posthumus

This project was created for the ABSA assessment for my application for a position.

Please ensure you have the database set up (you can find my SQL scripts in the 'sql' folder in this directory) and that the application runs on port 5001 as that is the SSL port the application uses.

DATABASE NAME USED: phonebook
